# Session 1* Chocolate bar

""" STATEMENT: Chocolate bar has the form of a rectangle divided into nÃ—m portions.
Chocolate bar can be split into two rectangular parts by breaking it along a selected straight line
on its pattern.

Determine whether it is possible to split it so that one of the parts will have exactly k squares.

The program reads three integers: n, m, and k. It should print YES or NO.

For example, on input 2 , 10, 7 output must be NO

TEMPLATE:

TESTS:
Input: 4, 2, 6 Output: YES
Input: 2, 10, 7 Output: NO
Input: 7, 4, 21 Output: YES
Input: 7, 1, 6 Output: YES
Input: 7, 1, 8 Output: NO
Input: 387, 13, 2709 Output: YES """
