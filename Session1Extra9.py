# Session 1* Queen Move

""" STATEMENT: Consider representation of chess board as in the problem Session 1 Problem 15: Chess Board
Chess queen moves horizontally, vertically or diagonally to any number of cells.
Given two different cells of the chessboard, determine whether a queen can go from the first cell
to the second in one move.

The program receives the input of four numbers from 1 to 8, each specifying the column and row number,
first two - for the first cell, and then the last two - for the second cell. The program should output
YES if a queen can go from the first cell to the second in one move, or NO otherwise.

For example, on input 4, 2, 6, 3, output must be NO
