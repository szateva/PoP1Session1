# Session 1: Fractional Part

""" STATEMENT: Given a positive real number, print its fractional part.

For example, on input 34.056 the output should be 0.056

Note.Due to imprecisions of float arithmetic, you may get 0.05599999 as the
result in the example above, which is "almost" correct.Use round operation
to get the correct output as in the example below:
n = 0.05599999
rounded_n = round(n, 3)  # rounding to 3 digits after .
# rounded_n will be 0.056

TESTS:
Input: 17.9 Output: 0.9
Input: 10.34 Output: 0.34
Input: 45 Output: 0.0
Input: 0.001 Output: 0.001 """
